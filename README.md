# PCBite SP10 Case

A 3D printable case for the PCBite SP10 probes. I was worried about bending/breaking the needle for the probe, so here we are.

I don't think slicer settings will matter much for this. But, for what it's worth, I printed with 4 walls and 5 solid top/bottom layers.

The holes are left a little big to account for the differences in the nut placement I noticed on my probes, but it might not be enough for every single one.
I've included a STEP file exported from onshape that you can use to make modifications if you need to. It's pretty messy, apologies for that.

Assembly is simple. Put the probe PCB in the bottom half and make sure everything is lined up correctly; there should be enough room to leave any jumpers connected if you want. Then set the top half on and slide the strap over the whole thing to hold it together.

Note that the strap has a draft on the sides of the opening so that it can sit flush with the angled sides of the case. You can use the arrows on the strap and the case to ensure you have everything oriented correctly.
